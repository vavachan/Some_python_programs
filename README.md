# Some_python_programs
These porgrams were written when I was trying to make some extra money by doing freelance coding. In the program Poly_fit.py I try to fit the data Thrust.dat using a polynomial of n - degree (n is the input). 

The program ELance_project_1.py is associated with the pdf file Elance_project. I was expected to find the minima of the function given in the question. I used some kind of brute force to find minimam because the function had a lot of local minimas. 

In these programs I used a lot of Inbuilt funcitons of python.

The program Poly_fit.py on running will give 3 files among which one is Graph.dat . which when plotted along with Thrust.dat will show the fit.
