# Some_python_programs
These porgrams were written when I was trying to make some extra money by doing freelance coding. In the program Poly_fit.py I try to fit the data Thrust.dat using a polynomial of n - degree (n is the input). 

In the program ELance_project_1.py is associated with the pdf file Elance_project. I was expected to find the minima of the function given in the question. I used some kind of brute force to find miniam because the function had a lot of local minimas. 

In these programs I used a lot of Inbuilt funcitons of python.
